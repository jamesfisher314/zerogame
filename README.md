# What is it?
This is my implementation of the 2.5d Pong described in [this guide|https://youtu.be/CoIiGX3u9Jc] by [CS50's Colton Ogden|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA]

# When was it created?
September 2019

# Where was it produced?
On my gaming desktop in Seattle

# Why did he do this?
- I'd rather produce something in my free time than consume what others have made
- Most of my personal code is useful but soulless
- I stumbled across [GameDevUnlocked|https://www.youtube.com/c/GameDevUnlocked] and realized I have more technical skills than David had when he created [The First Tree|https://www.thefirsttree.com/]
- Breakable Toy projects [(as detailed in Apprenticeship Patterns)|https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/] will let me build the skills I need to author my *dream game (tm)*
- This is a suitable first solo project in Unity
